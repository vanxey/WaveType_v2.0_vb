    "lyrics": "Arabella's got some interstellar gator skin boots\nAnd a helter-skelter 'round her little finger, and I ride it endlessly\nShe's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit\nAnd when she needs to shelter from reality, she takes a dip in my daydreams\n\nMy days end best when the sunset gets itself behind\nThat little lady sittin' on the passenger side\nIt's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light\nThe horizon tries, but it's just not as kind on the eyes\nAs Arabella, oh\nAs Arabella\n\nJust might've tapped into your mind and soul\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******\n(1409624309415)"
