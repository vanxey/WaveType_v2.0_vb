# WaveType Express Application Documentation

## Overview

WaveType is a web platform that enhances typing skills using music and lyrics-based typing lessons. It features a clean, engaging interface with interactive typing exercises. This Express-based platform serves as a typing practice application, integrating with APIs like Musixmatch to pull lyrics for users to type along to. It also tracks typing accuracy and speed through an interactive keyboard.

## `kbrd.js` - Clean Code Principles

### Overview of `kbrd.js`

`kbrd.js` is a module responsible for the interactive typing functionality of WaveType. It handles interactions such as simulating a digital keyboard, managing user input, tracking errors, and fetching lyrics from the Musixmatch API.

### Clean Code Principles Applied

In `kbrd.js`, I focused on following clean code principles to make the code easy to maintain. I tried to implement descriptive function names like `initializeKeyboard()` and `startTypingSession()` to make the code self-documenting. Functions are kept small with a single responsibility, such as `fetchLyrics()` for API calls and `renderTypingError()` for handling errors. I also made sure to use appropriate data types, like arrays for key presses and strings for lyrics. Error handling is managed with `try-catch` blocks, and the code behaves predictably to avoid surprises.

## Development Server Setup

To start the development server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanxey/WaveType_v2.0_vb.git
   cd WaveType_v2.0_vb
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will run the application on a local development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
